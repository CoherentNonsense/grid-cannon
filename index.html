                Grid cannon is a single player card game designed by
                <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/">Tom Francis</a>
                and it seemed like a fun game to try and recreate as a browser game.
                I changed the rules a little to get everything done
                if a shorter amount of time.
                You can find the full set of rules
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqmUpQjFHrA&feature=emb_title">here</a>
                or read my quicker version.<br><br>
                MY RULES:
                <ul>
                    GOAL: to kill all the royales(11, 12, 13 cards)
                    <li>SETUP: 8 cards are put in an O shape.
                        Any royale cards are put back on the top of the deck</li>
                    <li>MOVE: Take a card from the deck,
                        If it's a numbered card, place it in the center 3x3 grid.
                        It can only go on a card less than or equal to in value.<br>
                        If it's a royale card, place it on the outer ring.
                        It has to neighbor the most similar card to it.
                    </li>
                    <li>ATTACK: Whenver you place a number card, the cards between it and 
                        a royale will be added up and that number will be your "payload".<br>
                        To kill a joker, the payload must be higher than or equal to 11.<br>
                        To kill a queen, the payload must be higher than or equal to 12
                        and be the same color
                        To kill a king, the payload must be higher than or equal to 13
                        and be the same suite.
                    </li>
                    <li>LOSE: You lose if there are no more available move to play or
                        your deck runs out of cards
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </template>
